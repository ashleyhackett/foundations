<h3>The Trend to Watch: Data-Driven Personalization</h3>
	<p>
		Personalization, or data that is catered to each individual's tastes and habits, has seen huge growth in the past few years. Meeker's report shows that the search query "Near Me" grew 900 percent from 2015-2017, signaling that users crave personalized results. Similarly, media services like Spotify and Netflix offer "New Releases For You" or "You Might Like" sections to cater to people's individual tastes.
	</p>
	<p>
		In February and March of 2018, Evergage and Researchscape International <a href="https://www.evergage.com/resources/ebooks/trends-in-personalization-survey-report/" target="new">surveyed 300 marketing professionals</a> from five countries in 19 different industries about personalization. They found that "marketers overwhelmingly	agree (98%)	that	personalization	helps advance customer	
relationships,	with	74 percent	claiming	it	has	a	“strong”	or	“extreme”	impact." The study also found that 88 percent of respondants	said	their	"customers	and	prospects	expect	a	personalized	experience."
</p>
	<p>
		Marketing differs from journalism in many ways, but these survey results suggest that professionals in several industries view personalization as essential to their businesses moving forward. Journalists should, too.
	</p>
	<p>
		In an article called <a href="https://niemanreports.org/articles/the-power-of-personalization/" target="new">"The Power of Personalization"</a>, Nieman points out that a Google search for news takes into account one's "individual search history, geographic location, and other demographic information." Google has seen success with this model, and there is something to be said for making local news more accessible and customized to those who search for news within a certain zip code. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Some news organizations have begun to use personalization well: Many daily newspapers like the New York Times give their readers the option of subscribing to specific email newsletters like "California Today" and "The Morning Briefing." NPR One employs an <a href="http://digitalservices.npr.org/topic/npr-one-support-guide" target="new">algorithm</a> to help populate users’ streams with content that is likely to interest them.
	</p> 
	<p>
		But most of these personalized services are opt-in. In order to keep up with personalization trends, media outlets may have to start making these decisions for people.
	</p>
	<p>
		Journalists could step in front of this trend by using predictive algorithms to cater to their audience. Readers with preferences for reading stories about the Cubs, for example, would see Cubs game scores and statistics first when they log on to their preferred news outlet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another useful outlet for personalization would draw from geolocation. Someone reading the <em>New York Times</em> in India may see India-specific stories appear before someone reading in America. When environmental catastrophes hit or terrorist attacks hit, this type of personalization could enact social good.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the other hand, personalization of the news comes with ethical questions: Should a daily newspaper be able to cater news? Should its website look different to each user?
	</p>
	<p>
		Perhaps, if this were only used for situations like the Cubs fan mentioned above, personalization of the news wouldn't be a problem. But in politically charged situations, personalization can have an "echo chamber" effect in which an individual may only be exposed to viewpoints that support their own views. As exemplified in the most recent Presidential election, the echo chamber effect can have political and social consequence.
	</p>
	<p>
		If journalists are to accept personalization as a valuable part of their business, they ought to consider the social and political consequences of "filter bubbles" and weigh those consequences with any benefit a reader may find in personalized news.
