              People gather Oct. 2, 2018, to remember Eliyahu Moscowitz and Douglass Watts after they were both shot and killed in Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood.

          The back-to-back killings in Rogers Park seemed to be as random as they were brutal: an elderly man walking his dogs just steps from his home on Sunday and then, barely 36 hours later, a young man walking blocks away on the Lakefront Trail near Loyola Park. Both were shot once in the head, left for dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          But police on Tuesday confirmed what for many residents was their worst fear: The same gun was used to shoot both men, most likely by the same gunman. Just about every other detail remains a mystery.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is clear is that the killings of Douglass Watts, 73, and Eliyahu Moscowitz, 24, have shaken the neighborhood known for its diversity, prompting Mayor Rahm Emanuel to urge residents to use caution as they go about their daily lives.

          Chicago police said Watts and Moscowitz did not appear to know each other. Police have not found a motive behind the attacks. Nothing was taken from the victims during the shootings.

          Typically, much of the violence in Rogers Park stems from protracted gang feuds that erupt, many of them occurring within several blocks of the CTA Red Line station at Howard Street and along blocks that surround the Red Line stop at Morse Avenue.

          Both men, though, were shot in the eastern part of the neighborhood. Watts was killed in the 1400 block of West Sherwin Avenue, and Moscowitz was slain south of Loyola Park on the 1100 block of West Lunt Avenue.

          Chicago police released an image of the suspect in the fatal shooting of a 73-year-old man in Rogers Park on Sept. 30, 2018. Police have determined the same gun was used in the killing of a 24-year-old man, just blocks away, on the lakefront path by Loyola Park on Oct. 1. (Chicago Police Department)

          On Sept. 2, a doctoral student at Northwestern University was killed by apparent stray gunfire in the neighborhood while walking toward the Howard "L" station. Shane Colombo, 25, was fatally struck by gunfire near Howard and Clark streets about a mile and a half from where Moscowitz was found dead Monday night when two men began shooting each other.

          Almost exactly a year ago, 64-year-old Cynthia Trevillion, a teacher at Waldorf School in Rogers Park, was shot and killed Oct. 13 while walking with her husband to the Morse "L" station. Police have said that she was not the intended target of that shooting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ald. Joe Moore, 49th, who lives about a block and a half from where Watts was killed, said he could see why people are on edge.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "This is not something that is a common everyday occurrence in our neighborhood."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          "Obviously people are very concerned, understandably, and frightened," Moore said. "This is not something that is a common everyday occurrence in our neighborhood."
        </p>
        <p>
          At Tuesday's news conference, Emanuel expressed condolences to the victims, though he hadn't been able to reach both families.
